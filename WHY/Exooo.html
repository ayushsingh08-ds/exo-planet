        <h2>What is a Wormhole?</h2>
        <p>Wormholes are theoretical passages through spacetime that could create shortcuts for long journeys across the universe. They are based on solutions to Einstein's field equations in general relativity, suggesting that two distant points in space can be connected through a tunnel-like structure. If wormholes exist, they could potentially allow faster-than-light travel, making the exploration of far-off galaxies and exoplanets possible.</p>

        <h2>How Can Space Travel Work?</h2>
        <p>Space travel through wormholes is an extraordinary concept that could one day enable humanity to travel vast distances in mere moments. In theoretical physics, wormholes could allow us to bend spacetime, connecting two far-off points in space and creating a shortcut for travel. However, there are many challenges to making this science fiction a reality, including the need for vast amounts of energy and a better understanding of quantum physics.</p>
