                        Kepler-16b is an intriguing exoplanet located about 200 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus. It orbits two stars, making it a circumbinary planet, which means its skies feature two suns.

                        Kepler-16b is a gas giant, similar in size to Saturn, and it's mostly composed of gas rather than solid material. It lies outside its stars' habitable zone, meaning it is likely too cold to support life as we know it, with surface temperatures estimated to be around -100°C (-148°F). Discovered by NASA's Kepler Space Telescope in 2011, Kepler-16b was one of the first exoplanets found to orbit two stars.

                        51 Pegasi b is a gas giant, similar in size to Jupiter, but it's much closer to its star, completing an orbit in just about 4 days. This classifies it as a "hot Jupiter," a type of planet that is large and gaseous but orbits very close to its parent star. Its surface temperatures are extremely high due to its proximity, making it an inhospitable world. The discovery of 51 Pegasi b opened the door to the detection of thousands of other exoplanets.
