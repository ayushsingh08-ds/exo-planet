            <p>The climate and geography of exoplanets can vary significantly based on their distance from their host stars, atmospheric composition, and surface conditions. Some exoplanets may have conditions similar to Earth, while others can be incredibly hostile.</p>
            <p>Researchers study exoplanet atmospheres using spectroscopy to understand their composition and potential habitability. Factors such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of water are critical in assessing whether a planet could support life.</p>
