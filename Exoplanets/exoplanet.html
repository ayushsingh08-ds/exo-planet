            <p>Exoplanets are planets located outside our solar system, orbiting stars other than the Sun. They vary widely in size, composition, and distance from their host stars.</p>
            <p>The study of exoplanets has become a major focus of astronomical research, particularly in the search for potentially habitable worlds.</p>
            <p>Methods of discovery include the transit method, where a planet passes in front of its star, causing a temporary dimming of the star's light, and the radial velocity method, which measures variations in the star's speed due to gravitational tugs from orbiting planets.</p>
