            <p>Exoplanets form from the residual gas and dust left over from star formation. This process, known as accretion, involves the collision and sticking together of small particles to form larger bodies.</p>
            <p>The conditions of the surrounding environment, including the amount of material and temperature, play a crucial role in determining the types of planets that form. Some planets may form close to their stars, while others can form in the outer regions of the solar system.</p>
